# Use cases
* AS a developer, I want to estimate the carbon impact of my application (which uses several infrastructure components)
* As a developer / admin, I want to be able to see the carbon impact of my application over time (in dashboards)

# TODO : complete readme 

This project is an implementation of the Impact engine Framework, that provides : 
* An API : to calculate carbon metrics of an application (ad-hoc)
* A metrics exporter : which allows to build impact dashboards to help reduce carbon impact
* A python implementation of the framework 
* An SCI model for compute server, based on the SCI study case : https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/sci-guide/blob/dev/use-case-submissions/dow-msft-Graph-DB.md
